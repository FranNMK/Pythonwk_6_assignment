# 🐍 Python Week 6 Assignment  

This repository contains solutions to the **Week 6 Python Assignment**, demonstrating the use of popular Python libraries for data manipulation, numerical analysis, data visualization, and API requests.  

---

## 📌 Features / Tasks Completed  

1. **NumPy Task**  
   - Created an array of numbers from 1 to 10.  
   - Calculated the mean of the array.  

2. **Pandas Task**  
   - Built a small dataset with names, ages, and scores.  
   - Loaded it into a Pandas DataFrame.  
   - Displayed summary statistics (count, mean, std, etc.).  

3. **Requests Task**  
   - Fetched **live weather data** using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/).  
   - Displayed current temperature and windspeed for Berlin.  

4. **Matplotlib Task**  
   - Plotted a simple line graph of numbers vs their squares.  
   - Styled with markers, grid, labels, and title.

## 📊 Example Output

### NumPy

```
NumPy Array: [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10]
Mean of array: 5.5
```

### Pandas

```
   Name  Age  Score
0  Alice   24     85
1    Bob   30     90
2 Charlie   18     78
3  David   35     92
```

### API (Weather)

```
Current Temperature in Berlin: 17.8 °C
Current Windspeed in Berlin: 8.5 km/h
```

### Matplotlib

* Line graph of numbers vs. squares will pop up in a new window.

---

## ✨ Future Improvements

* Allow user input for city/location in the weather API.
* Add more advanced Pandas data analysis.
* Save plots as images automatically.
